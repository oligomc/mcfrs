# Minecraft Fishing Rod Snagging (mcfrs)

## Description
Fishing rods enchanted with Lure have a chance to snag armor or hand items from hooked entities. Higher levels of Lure have a greater chance of snagging items.

## Installation
Once the data pack is [installed](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack), type `/reload` in-game to load all data pack assets.

The data pack can be disabled in-game using the function `frs:uninstall`, whereafter the contents can be removed from the data packs folder.

## Usage
To snag an item, hook a mob or player with a fishing rod enchanted with `Lure` and `use` the fishing rod on a hooked entity.

`Lure` fishing rods can snag an item from hand slots (`mainhand` or `offhand`) or armor slots (`feet`, `legs`, `chest`, or `head`). Fishing rods with `Lure I` have a `10` percent chance to snag successfully, and the chance of success increases by `10` percent every level up to `Lure III`. Each slot has a uniform chance of being snagged. Armor pieces with the `binding_curse` enchantment cannot be snagged!
